  "description": "This video captures the dynamic energy of a group of seagulls as they soar and glide along the coastline. The scene is filled with the flurry of wings and the distinctive calls of the birds, set against a backdrop of the open sky and shimmering water. The seagulls, with their crisp white and gray feathers, create a sense of freedom and movement that embodies the spirit of the sea. Perfect for content related to coastal environments, bird migrations, or the natural beauty of marine life."
